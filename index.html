      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        No one in the world is not familiar with the word "Friend". Almost
        everyone is aware of this word and its importance in life. The word
        carries a fragrance in itself. The friend is like the base of a house
        who is present in life and makes a house beautiful. We don't compare to
        the moments when we are with our friends, the moments may be in long
        drives, holidays, summer vacations, or group studies. We believe in our
        friends too because we know that whenever we are in any problem or
        crisis, our friends are present there without selflessness. They are
        important in our lives and Hinduism's "Lord Krishna and Sudama"
        friendship is an example of a true and selfless story, which tells us
        the importance of friends. In our childhood, we choose our friends who
        play with us, we grow together, we study, and we enjoy every moment
        together. It is a relation whose experience varies for everyone, but a
        common factor is its impact on life is wordless. Nowadays, friends have
        become more valuable and true friends are rare. A good statement is
        delivered by the philosopher Plato.

      <h2 id="first-meeting">The First Meeting</h2>
      <p>
        I clearly remember the day, that was Monday in school. We met in the
        morning during the period of Science, my age was sixteen. It was our
        first meeting. He was sitting on a bench I noticed that day. He forgot
        the ID of the school. I went near him and told him "Are you Manu?" This
        was my first sentence about our friendship. Then we spent a lot of time
        with each other. In school, in coaching classes, on the ground, in
        swimming classes, everywhere we both went together. That time was very
        good for us. He provided me with notes when I was absent from the
        classroom or coaching. He cared for my plants very well in my absence
        which we planted on the school campus, on the side of the botanical
        garden. I remember how he helped me one day when I had forgotten my
        purse at home and I needed Rs.500 urgently for the submission of annual
        fees. At that time it was the last day of the submission fee. He asked
        me how he could help. Initially, I ignored the issue but due to his
        persistence, I told him the story. Within an hour, he managed the money
        for me. I was unaware of how he managed it and from whom, but he did
        that. From that day on, our friendship bond became stronger day by day.

      <h2 id="qualities">The Qualities of My Friend</h2>
      <p>
        He has many qualities that make him a humble and attractive man. Some of
        the qualities are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Nature Lover:</strong> He is always down to earth. He belongs
          to a rich family but his attitude is always helpful to others, and he
          is a very grounded man who never forgets his roots and culture. Once,
          I was with him on a summer vacation when we went to his village. When
          I asked him, "You have proper money, why don’t you spend your
          vacations at a hill station?", he simply replied, "I can go, but I
          don’t want to. My ancestors were from the village." This was not the
          only instance that showed his nature, but it was evident in his
          clothing, walking style, and conversation. He doesn’t use social
          media, which tells of his simple nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Passion for Hobbies:</strong> My friend is very punctual. Even
          though sometimes I forget the time for any work, he doesn’t. His
          passion for his hobbies is intense. Near his house, there is a club
          famous in the area for kabaddi tournaments and practice. Every Sunday,
          he goes to the club and starts his kabaddi practice. I never
          understood why he was so interested in this game. His dedication to
          the game never waned. Once, he received bad grades in an exam and
          needed to make more effort in a particular subject to improve his
          grades. The next Sunday, he skipped his studies and went to the club
          again.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gratitude:</strong> One thing that makes him different or
          interesting is his gratitude. This trait is very rare, and people
          often forget about the things or blessings they have received. Once,
          our whole class went outside for a picnic. He found a broken watch
          there that was not so beautiful or high-quality. He took it and asked
          every student who was present there if it belonged to them. The next
          day, he asked everyone again, but no one was interested in the watch.
          When I told him to throw it away, he didn’t react. The next day, the
          watch was strapped to his left hand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="impact">How Did He Make an Impact on Me?</h2>
      <p>
        My friend Manu made a significant impact on my life. Because of him, in
        childhood, I spent a lot of time with a person who was a deep thinker,
        attached to culture, had no arrogance, and was always punctual. These
        qualities provided the foundation for my life, reflecting positivity in
        my actions. Whenever I face any issue or situation, he always stands by
        me, offering support and guidance.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        We all choose friends in our lives, and they are important because they
        help us and make an impact on us—often a timeless impact. They improve
        our quality of life. However, not all friends are good or
        well-intentioned. Some are selfish and put their preferences first in
        any situation. Nowadays, good friends are rare to find. Some people ruin
        their friend's lives by introducing them to harmful habits like
        alcoholism or other addictions for their own benefit. We need to be
        aware of this type of friend. A good friend always keeps their
        friendship a priority and will guide their friend towards making good
        decisions in life. In contrast, bad friends never support their friends;
        they only use them. After they fulfill their needs, they abandon them.
        It is important to give our time and effort to a good friend who
        improves both lives.
